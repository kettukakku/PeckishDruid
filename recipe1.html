        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of fresh pine needles</li>
            <li>4 cups of water</li>
            <li>Honey or your sweetener of choice (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Utensils & Cookware</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A tea strainer or fine mesh sieve</li>
            <li>A medium-sized cooking pot</li>
            <li>A heating element or open flame</li>
            <li>A cup or thermos to enjoy your beverage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Harvest fresh pine needles and make sure to select those that are still green and aromatic. Avoid harvesting from areas that have been treated with pesticides or other chemicals. </li>
            <li>Rinse the needles thoroughly in water to remove any dirt or debris. Pat them dry when finished.</li>
            <li>Break the needles into smaller pieces â€” not too fine as to make straining difficult but enough to allow the natural flavor of the needles to extract more easily.</li>
            <li>In a cooking pot, bring the water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped pine needles to the pot and reduce the heat to a simmer. Allow the pine needles to steep for 15-20 minutes or to your preferred strength.</li>
            <li>Once the flavor has been extracted, strain the tea into your cup or thermos.</li>
            <li>If desired, sweeten the tea with honey or even add your favorite aromatics like lemon for extra flavor.</li>
        </ol>
