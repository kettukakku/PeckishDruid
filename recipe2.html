        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 head of romaine lettuce</li>
            <li>Seasonal flowers (such as violets or pansies)</li>
            <li>Seasonal greens (such as dandelion or wild spinach)</li> 
            <li>Seasonal herbs (such as lemon balm or mint)</li>    
            <li>Seasonal berries (such as blackberries or wild strawberries)</li> 
            <li>Garden vegetables (such as carrots or cucumbers)</li>  
        </ul>

        <h2>Utensils & Cookware</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A sharp blade and cutting board</li>
            <li>A mortar and pestle</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the foragables by rinsing them in water and patting them dry.</li>
            <li>Separate the romaine lettuce leaves and set them aside. The true fun is about to begin!</li>
            <li>Let the season's bounty guide you. Prune and chop unruly leaves, mash fresh berries into a smooth jam, and experiment! Your spring rolls should be crafted to your taste.</li>
            <li>Once the foragables have been prepared to your liking, spread them along the vein of the romaine leaves.</li>
            <li>Fold the long side of the romaine leaf over your filling and roll it taut â€” careful not to tear it.</li>
            <li>If you have any foragables left, mash them into a fine paste and use them as a dipping sauce for your floral spring rolls.</li>
        </ol>
